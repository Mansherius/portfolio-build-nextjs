						The project aimed to develop a simple yet effective password manager
						capable of securely storing and retrieving passwords for multiple

					Key features included user authentication and login, a personalized
					dashboard for each user, a database to store password details, and
					robust encryption to protect data during transmission.

						I leveraged Pythonâ€™s DASH module to construct the front-end of the
						multi-page website.{" "}

					This choice allowed me to seamlessly combine Python, HTML, and CSS
					within a single environment. The login, registration, and index pages
					were designed as separate templates, each adhering to a consistent
					visual style for a cohesive user experience. The user dashboard was
					dynamically rendered within the main app page, offering personalized
					access to stored passwords.

					While DASH enabled rapid development and integration, its limitations
					in flexibility and performance became apparent, highlighting the need
					for more advanced front-end frameworks. However, at the time, this was
					the most effective solution given my familiarity with available
					technologies.

						The backend of this project is built using Flask and SQLite for

					Flask handles routing, session management, and user authentication,
					while SQLite serves as the database for storing user credentials and
					related data. The application includes custom cryptographic
					implementations, using RSA for secure communication and Schnorr
					signatures for user verification. Flask&apos;s application context is also
					utilized to manage database connections efficiently, ensuring the
					smooth operation of the system.

					User data and certificates are encrypted using custom DSA keys, with a
